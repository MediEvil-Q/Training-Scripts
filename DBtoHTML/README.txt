Task (not mandatory):

1. Install Apache server onto your server and configure it to work with domain name: andreys-task.rbeat.gq (Don't worry, I've pointed the domain name for you)

2. Install CertBot and make sure that the future website is secured with an SSL certificate (remember old days?)

3. Create a script that will generate HTML file inside of Apache "Main DocumentRoot" folder with the contents similar to Top5ProductsScript output; however, uses HTML schema to show the data. (You can check out this example: https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_table_intro . You can bring CSS from there as well, but it's not necessary.)

4. Add your full name at the bottom of the page (Copyright with current year). Also, add update time. (Example: (c) 2020 Andrey Sokolov. Last updated: Mon Dec  7 17:02:02 EET 2020)

5. Test it, then add it to crontab in order to update the HTML page every minute.

At the very end, upload the following stuff to your Git repo:
1. Script itself
2. Copy of the HTML file generated by the script
3. crontab snapshot in the .txt file
4. Output of the OpenSSL check of the website
